# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Case-Study

---------------
## **Problem Statement**

### **Context**

**A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows.** Typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost. This may be beneficial to hotel guests, but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.

The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customersâ€™ booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further dimension to the challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.

This pattern of cancellations of bookings impacts a hotel on various fronts:
1. **Loss of resources (revenue)** when the hotel cannot resell the room.
2. **Additional costs of distribution channels** by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.
3. **Lowering prices last minute**, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.
4. **Human resources to make arrangements** for the guests.

### **Objective**

This increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal - they are facing problems with this high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. You, as a Data Scientist, have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
